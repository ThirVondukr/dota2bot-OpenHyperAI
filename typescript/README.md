## Introduction

Future development work for this script will be written in ts as possible. In long term, you can consider the lua files under `<root>/bots/` folder are all generated by the ts scripts under `<root>/typescript/bots/`.

Start from here, please use typescript to write the bot logic in ts and build to generate the relative lua files.
More about "Write Lua with TypeScript": https://typescripttolua.github.io/

### Developer notes

1. Create the files/folders in typescript in the same file structure as in the root bots folder.
1. Always try to modify/update ts files first for any modification, because ts files can replace the lua files and override whatever you might have changed in lua files.
1. `jmz_func.lua` is now moved under typescipt folder as well and it's to be converted to ts next.

## Usage

1. Install node.
1. Install yarn. `npm install --global yarn`
1. Install dependencies. `yarn install`
1. Compile to generate lua files. `npm run build`
